            <p>Some of the features include: a top button by yours truly, a consistent navigation bar on top, several animations to each button and images, and several modules such as generic containers for whenever I need to add new stuff to the site. This site will constantly evolve, including new projects and a persistent way to keep my blog in check. It will forever be a Work In Progress (WIP) site.</p>

            <p>Besides being a really much smaller project, I'm really proud of the edits I took this far. there's a finalized version of this, and a couple of drafts.</p>
            <p>As the title says, this is a manual focused on making a fairly simple lego house. One of the more notable features is really the Visual and information hiearchy (aka headers) used to organize this. This was done for class, but I continuously tried to improve it after class to make it a more polished product.</p>
            <p>As a finalized version, it is a more visually appealing manual that's fairly easy to read, with top down AND orhtogonal angles for each step of the proccess</p>

            <p>It's a summarily very hefty manual; spanning 32 pages of pictures and notes and appendices.</p>
            <p>This has been improved since I've left my position: Introducing a new visual style of headings. Also, colors to indicate more clearly the hiearchy of information within the manual.</p>
            <p>One of the particuarily neat stuff is the modularity of each step; they're seperated into boxes which can be reused time and time again. It's a very neat way of using tables in this way.</p>
